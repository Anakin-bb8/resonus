/**
 * The back chevron every screen's top bar draws.
 *
 * A tap goes back one screen, as it always did. A long press drops the whole
 * pile at once: an artist, its album, another artist off a track and a genre
 * from there is four taps back to somewhere you can search from (#96).
 *
 * It lets you out where you came in. A stack opened from the Library ends at
 * the Library and one opened from a search ends at Search, which is where you
 * were going anyway; and it is not the tab the app happens to open on, so
 * nobody is dropped into a list of albums they never asked for.
 *
 * Nothing on screen announces the long press, which is why it is a shortcut and
 * not the answer: whoever wants the way out in plain sight turns on the
 * navigation bar in Settings › Appearance.
