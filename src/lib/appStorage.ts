/**
 * What the app keeps on this phone besides the music, measured.
 *
 * Downloads have their own accounting (the catalog knows what each file took
 * when it was written), and the offline copy of the library reports its own
 * size. What was left over was everything else: the lyrics saved next to
 * downloads, the index of a scanned local library and its covers, the pictures
 * put on local playlists. Each of them small on its own and none of them
 * visible anywhere, which is how a phone ends up with a few hundred megabytes
 * belonging to an app that says it is using none.
 *
 * Sizes come from the file system in one call per folder rather than by
 * walking them here: adding up thousands of files one at a time on the JS
 * thread is what made this screen stutter before (#50).
