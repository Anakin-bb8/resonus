/**
 * The radios on Home: which artists get one, what goes in it, and when the
 * set is rebuilt.
 *
 * A radio is a seed artist (the one in its title, "… Radio") plus similar
 * artists mixed beside it - never a saved playlist: nothing is written to
 * the server. The def carries a snapshot of the tracks it opened with, so
 * the screen is already full the first time it is drawn, and a fresh list is
 * asked for whenever it has gone stale - the mix still reflects the library
 * as it is now.
 *
 * The seeds come from the server's own play counts, which is where every
 * listen lands anyway: the player reports to the server, and the server
 * passes it on to Last.fm or ListenBrainz when it is set up for that. A
 * local profile has the same counts, so there is one path to read and
 * nothing to fill in.
