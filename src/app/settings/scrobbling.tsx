/**
 * Settings › Quality & playback › Scrobbling: when a song counts as played.
 *
 * Two rules rather than one number: a share of the song, which is what makes a
 * listen mean the same on a two-minute track and on a ten-minute one, and a
 * flat time, which is what keeps the long ones from asking for five minutes
 * before they count. Either can be off, and the earlier one is what fires. What
 * they add up to lives in `scrobbleThresholdSec` (#126).
