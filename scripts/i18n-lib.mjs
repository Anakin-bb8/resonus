/**
 * What the translation tools all need: the English source, each locale, the
 * notes, and — the part that is worked out rather than written down — where in
 * the app each string shows up.
 *
 * Somebody translating a JSON file is looking at "Direction": "" with nothing
 * around it, and the question they ask is always the same one: where is this,
 * what is it. Half of that answer is already in the code. Every string reaches
 * the screen through a `t('…')` call in a file, and in this app a file under
 * `src/app/` IS a screen, so the path is the answer: `src/app/settings/player`
 * is Settings › Player. Deriving it costs nothing and cannot fall behind, which
 * a table kept by hand in a document had been doing for three releases.
 *
 * The other half, what a word means when it is ambiguous on its own, cannot be
 * derived and lives in `src/i18n/context.jsonc`.
